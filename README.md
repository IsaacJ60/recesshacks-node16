## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating SurveyScreen stemmed from the aspiration to make personalized healthcare guidance accessible to all. With an abundance of medical screenings and tests available, it's easy to feel lost in a sea of options, and not know what is actually important to you.

## What it does
SurveyScreen is an AI-powered health web app designed to put you in control of your well-being journey. By simply taking our health survey, you'll unlock personalized AI-driven advice on the medical screenings you should be taking that could make all the difference.

## How we built it
To build SurveyScreen, we used React for the UI, OpenAI API for generating the AI responses and recommendations, and hosted & deployed on Vercel.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was obtaining the user's form results and feeding it into the OpenAI API. We solved this by making the surveys and AI response generation code parent-child components, and passed data using props.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud our ability to quickly learn and utilize React, a technology our team had no prior experience with. Moreover, the consistent and accurate recommendations from our utilization of OpenAI API led to a smooth and high-quality user experience.

## What we learned
During the making of SurveyScreen, we gained invaluable knowledge on web-development, with React as a focal point. Additionally, we learned how to employ OpenAI API with JavaScript.

## What's next for SurveyScreen
We plan to add a feature where the user can find medical offices where they can directly book appointments to get their screenings done. Another feature for the future would be for the user to add themselves to a family so we can use family/genetic history as another variable in what screenings to recommend.
